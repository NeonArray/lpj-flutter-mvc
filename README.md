# License Plate Judas

This app is an exploration of learning and utilizing Dart/Flutter as a framework. It is not intended to be well architected or production ready. With that being said however,
I attempted to implement an MVC approach, whether good or bad. I wanted to see how well it would fit into Flutter and if it's a viable option for building apps.

I already can see the benefit in using Google's BLoC pattern over other approaches, as configuring state
and reactivity is sort of a pain with MVC. Once I complete this project, I will re-write the app again
using the BLoC pattern to really gauge key differences.
